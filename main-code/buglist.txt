When driving away from a wall, sometimes the back wall change is not detected and the front one is used instead

When doing gyroturnsteps, it sometimes turns the wrong amount

The first gyroturn without a preceeding drivestep could have some zero-variables



Communication features to implement:
Tell colours (sort of done)
Tell if ramp driven up
Direction for rescue kits
