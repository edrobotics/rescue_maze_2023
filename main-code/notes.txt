Make a function to calculate the difference between any angles - can replace some code present now.

pidDrive() - the distance error when both sides are present can be calculated (left-right)/2

gyroTurn() - can turn more than 180 degrees. Divide it into < 180 degree segments.

General - add some way of filtering out unreasonable results and falling back to "dumb" methods in those cases.

Bugs:
Sometimes when the robot is close to a wall, it drives slowly forward and sometimes does not recognise the wall.
