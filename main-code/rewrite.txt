Check that the initialization of bool arrays sets all elements to false

When detecting wallchanges, maybe indicate directly with lightning instead of doing it when stopping?

Add condition that a wallchange distance update cannot be too far from the "real" distance.
The reason for this is that when the robot drove back, it drove a whole step too far.
With wallchanges, I need to compensate for the robot angle.
