When driving away from a wall, sometimes the back wall change is not detected and the front one is used instead

When doing gyroturnsteps, it sometimes turns the wrong amount. WHY?

When driving onto a colour, the robot stops too late



Communication features to implement:
Tell colours (sort of done)
Tell if ramp driven up
