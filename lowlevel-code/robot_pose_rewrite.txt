Problems:
When driving, sometimes the robot drives too far
When driving past a corner, the robot turns and stays turned (believes it is straight?)
Sometimes, wall detection using the front ultrasonic sensor does not work - probably due to restricted max correction distance (fixed? not flashed)


Left to do:
Fix last known distances (angle correction in wallchanges) to use xDist instead
Translation of last x and y distance when turning
